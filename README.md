# EE0005_Classify_Cusine-
Problem: Can we classify the type of cuisine based on the ingredients provided? 

# Data Acquisition 
Essential Libraries

NumPy : Library for Numeric Computations in Python <br/>
Pandas : Library for Data Acquisition and Preparation <br/>
Matplotlib : Low-level library for Data Visualization <br/>
Seaborn : Higher-level library for Data Visualization <br/>

## Import Data and Clean Data 

## Explore the Dataset 
- Count the number of types of cuisines in dataset 
- Number of ingredients per cuisine meal
- Average number of ingredients per cuisine 
- Count of ingredients in dataset 

## Preparing the Dataset 
- Remove unnecessary rows/columns 
- Create train and testing set 

## Analyze the Dataset 
- Decision Tree Model - accuracy of model 
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC) - accuracy of model 
- K-Means Clusterring - explanations for wrong prediction 

## Conclusion 
- We are able to use Decision Tree Model and Random Forest Classifier to predict cuisines based on ingredients provided
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC) has a higher accuracy than Decision Tree Model and can prevent the overfitting of data
- Some cuisines have high similarities in their cooking ingredients which results in the wrong prediction
